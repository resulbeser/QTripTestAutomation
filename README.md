This project is a modular, scalable test automation framework built for the QTripDynamic web application. It leverages Java, TestNG, and Maven to structure and execute UI tests, following the Page Object Model for maintainability and clarity. Dynamic test data is generated and externalized for repeatable execution, while ExtentReports integration ensures professional, traceable reporting with suite-level and test case-level insights. To run the tests, simply execute the testing.xml TestNG suite file located in the project root using IntelliJ or the command line. Maven handles dependencies and build lifecycle, making the framework easy to extend and CI-ready.
